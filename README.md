# Description
This repository allows you to get started with a gui based training a Deep Learning model with no detailed configuration needed! Set your labeled dataset and start the training right away and monitor it with TensorBoard or DLTGUI tool.

In the words of Stephen Hawking:
> Science is beautiful when it makes simple explanations of phenomena or connections between different observations. Examples include the double helix in biology and the fundamental equations of physics.

# Getting started
### Prerequisites
- Anaconda 64-bit
- Python 3.7.3
- Tensorflow 2.0.0 
- Numpy 1.16.4
- Matplotlib
- PIL
- subprocess
- pathlib



### Dataset Folder Structure
The following is an example of how a dataset should be structured. Before you train a deep learning model, put all your dataset into datasets directory.

```
├──datasets/
    ├──example_dataset/
        ├── images
        │   ├── img_1.jpg/png
        │   └── img_2.jpg/png
    ├──flower_photos/
        ├── daisy
        │── dandelion
        │── roses
        │── sunflowers
        │── tulips
        
For image classification.
```
